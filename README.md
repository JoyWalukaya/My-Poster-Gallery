🎨 My Posters Gallery  

Welcome to My Posters Gallery – a simple and visually appealing site where I showcase the posters I create! 🚀  

📌 About  
This site dynamically displays all the posters I add to my collection. Every time I create a new poster, I simply upload it to the folder and run a Python script to update the gallery automatically.  

 🔥 Features  
- Displays posters in a clean, responsive grid  
- Auto-updates when new posters are added  
- Minimal & modern design  
- Fast and lightweight  

 🖼️ How It Works  
1. Add new images to the folder  
2. Run the Python script (`update_images.py`) to refresh the list  
3. The site updates automatically to display new posters 🎉
